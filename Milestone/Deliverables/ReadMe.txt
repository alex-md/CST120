       As part of our CST 120 class's Milestone 1 assignment, we had to create
       a sitemap and wireframe for our website, as well as our initial code base
       to demonstrate our understanding of HTML tags and basic formatting.
       Here is the link to the video demonstration
       (https://www.loom.com/share/438556c6d0e2457f8df39de0fab74dd7).
       I also made my own logo using the Adobe Logo Generator.
       In addition to the code,I have also included the wireframe mockups I
       used to demonstrate my thinking process during the construction and
       design of my website.
